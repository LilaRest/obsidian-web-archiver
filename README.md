# Web Archiver üìÅ

## Why should I use that plugin ?
**The web is very volatile**, from a day to the other a website can be **broken**, **modified** or even **shutted down**.
As a result, as time goes on, a part of the URLs you pasted into your Obsidian's vault are very likely to not return anymore the content you had seen at paste-time. Leading to a direct **loss of your sources and inspirations**.

**The Web Archiver plugin solves that problem by taking snapshots all the URL's you will paste in your Obsidian.**

More preciselly, each pasted URL will be sent to archiving providers (like '[Internet Archive](archive.org)'), which will indefinitely store the content you've seen at paste-time, allowing you to browse that one even if the original website have been broken, modified or shutted down.
